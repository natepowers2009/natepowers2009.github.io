      Guest Mode Tutorial
    </header
    <p>Notice: PLEASE read through this at least once before going through the steps. Some people like to just get it over with without giving it a second though amd it ends up biting them back. It is entirely possible this doesn't work, so please think twice and bee sure before you do something undoable! - Nathan</p>
    <p>Note: This tutorial has only been PROVEN to work on about 50 PERCENT of DEKALB COUNTY issued devices. This IS NOT GARUNTEED TO WORK IN ANY CAPACITY, PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
    <p1>FOLLOW THIS TUTORIAL WORD FOR WORD! DOING EVEN A SINGLE STEP INCORRECTLY MESSES UP THIS PROCESS!</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Step 1: Powerwash your device. This can be done by holding the ESC key, the Refresh key, and the Power button at the same time. Note: THIS WILL DELETE EVERYTHING ON YOUR COMPUTER.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Step 2: The screen should boot up in a screen that says Chrome OS is missing or damaged. Press CTRL D and confirm to enter dev mode.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Step 3: The screen will boot saying press enter to turn OS Verification back on. Do as it says, pressing the enter key to enter a normal state.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Step 4: The screen should now look like as if you'd booted it up for the first time. Good, this is what we want. Now, go to the menu in the bottom left corner and click wifi, and register under any wifi.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Step 5: Inside this menu, click the context box that says Direct Internet Connection, and set it to Manual proxy configuration.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Step 6: Type something random in each box. MAKE SURE EACH BOX IS DIFFERENT, OR THIS WILL NOT WORK. Next, scroll down and turn off automatic IP configuration, then scroll down and click google's name servers.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Step 7: Close the wifi menu and power off the computer. Then power it back on. Click get started.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Step 8: If done correctly, you should now see a scren asking you to select a wifi. Select the wifi you had registered under your computer earlier, then wait for the screen to load.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Step 9: The load should fail, telling you the wifi you selected didn't work. Click the wifi you selected, then click the disconnect button and the connect button in quick succession. CONTINUE TO NEXT STEP.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Step 10: Immediately close the wifi menu. On the middle-left side of the screen for a brief moment after the loading finishes will be a blue link that says BROWSE AS GUEST. CLick it immediately. The timing is difficult, and failing will create a no internet error screen. If you fail, go to the start of step 7 and follow from there.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Step 11: Congrats! If you followed the steps closely, you should now be in guest mode. Just a small moment more of setup, and you're free to go. Click the bottom right corner menu and click wifi, then the gear. Scroll down to network and turn mon auto-IP-config, and click auto name servers. This restores internet to functionality to the device.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>With all that said, you are free to go. Just keep in mind these pros and cons to guest mode before you decide to go and activate everything:</p>
    <br>
    <p>Pros: No websites are blocked</p>
    <br>
    <p>Cons: It is impossible to download apps or extensions. Signing out, battery dying, or fully powering the device off will result in guest mode being exited. Exiting guest mode basically powerwashes the device, deleting files and sign in data.</p>
    <br>
    <p1>I hope you found this guide useful! I defenitely intend to make more guides like this as I discover more exploits. Use these exploits responsibly.</p1>
