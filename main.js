/*
Note: I would like to clarify that I am absolutely HORRIBLE at javascript, and just still learning with html and css. 
The main.js page is one of my major testing grounds for learning javascript.
I have been learning javascript, html, and css self-taught for a few months now, and have yeilded wonderful results.
If there is any requests for ideas as to what I should add to this webstie, contact me in person or at nathanpowers2009@gmail.com.
Thank you for using my website!
