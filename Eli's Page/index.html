  <p>Hi, made this page to guide you around, I'll probably end up updating it later. I made this site for hosting games and my discord server.</p>
  <p>I currently am studying an exploit known as guest mode. I'll get back to you once I've made a breakthrough. In the meantime, I've added the discord server link and sent you a google doc for easy contact. :)</p>
  <p>I aint giving up man, and neither should you. I'm working things out man. In the meantime, I sent you a google doc. Try and find it. It should be under my name.</p>
